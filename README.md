Industrial Informatics

This code is created as a assignment for a course. 

The code follows the MVC-design pattern.
Model.py - creates the data base and handles the MQTT communication
View.py - creates the front (using flask), html templates can be found in the "templates"-folder
Controller.py - combines view and model functions together to control different data structures (alarms, event history etc.)
